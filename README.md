Frontend Mentor - Fylo landing page with dark theme and features grid

The task was to build out the project from scratch, except the images and font-name has been provided. 

The designs were in JPG static format. The reason for this, as opposed to including Sketch (or other similar design software) files, was to help train your eye when developing. This will mean that i had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. The purpose of this was, to simulate a real-life project, were sometimes you do not have access to full design files etc.
