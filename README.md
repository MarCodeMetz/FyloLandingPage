The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. The reason for this, as opposed to including Sketch (or other similar design software) files, is to help train your eye when developing. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help when you're working on real projects, but do have access to full design files.
